    <h2>IB Pseudocode Tool by Mats Macke</h2>
    <p id="about-text">
        This website is a tool to develop and test IB Pseudocode in order to practice for IB Computer Science exams. 
        This has been possible in the past with Mr Dave Mulkey's <a class="link" href="http://ibcomp.fis.edu/pseudocode/pcode.html">
        EZ Pseudocode</a>, but most students agree that tool is not very pleasant to use. This tool should be nicer to use.
        I am aware that my compiler is by no means perfect yet, and some programs may cause bugs. Please do report these by 
        adding an issue on the GitHub repository, linked below. 
    </p>
